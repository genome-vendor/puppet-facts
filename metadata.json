  "description": "This module allows you to create arbitrary Puppet Facts using Puppet code or your Hiera backend. This can be useful to document your machines or even your Puppet classes. A class could for example create it's own Fact, which when queried by a different class, could determine if the class has been applied to the machine or any other state that might be interesting to report."
